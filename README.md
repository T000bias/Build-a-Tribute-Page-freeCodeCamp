## Description from freeCodeCamp
1. Your tribute page should have an element with a corresponding `id="main"`, which contains all other elements

2. You should see an element with an  `id` of `title`, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")

3. You should see either a figure or a div element with an `id` of `img-div`

4. Within the `img-div` element, you should see an img element with a corresponding `id="image"`

5. Within the `img-div` element, you should see an element with a corresponding `id="img-caption"` that contains textual content describing the image shown in `img-div`

6. You should see an element with a corresponding `id="tribute-info"`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page


7. You should see an a element with a corresponding `id="tribute-link"`, which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to `_blank` in order for your link to open in a new tab.

8. Your `#image` should use `max-width` and height properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

9. Your img element should be centered within its parent element

Fulfill the user stories and pass all the tests below to complete this project. Give it your own personal style. Happy Coding!

Note: Be sure to add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` in your HTML to link your stylesheet and apply your CSS
